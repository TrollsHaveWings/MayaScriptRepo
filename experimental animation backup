# What is Experimental Animation?

## Previous Theoretical Definitions

#### Paul Wells' contrast between "experimental" and "orthodox" animation

In his book "Understanding Animation" Considered by many a seminal book in the world of animation, author Paul Wells discusses the definitions of experimental animation and what he calls orthodox animation referring to more commercial works, he also uses the word developmental animation which he defines as "a mode of expression combining or selecting elements of both approaches" (Wells, 1998).

In his book he specifically talks about Disneys cell animation style and how at the time and perhaps to this day "remains the most convenient technique for the mass production of cartoons" and therefore Paul Wells says "It Constitutes what may be understood as orthodox animation" (Wells, 1998, p.36).

In the above referenced table from his book we can see he uses a set of what he calls "Terms and Conditions" for orthodox animation which he contrasts to also create a set of terms and conditions for what is experimental (Wells, 1998, p.36) below we will break down how each of these "Terms and Conditions" are defined by Wells (1998).

According to Paul Wells (1998), orthodox or commercial animation adheres to traditional conventions, characterized by recognizable human or animal figures, logical narrative continuity, and a strong emphasis on character-driven stories with conflicts and resolutions. These animations prioritize the evolution of context, maintaining a consistent visual style that minimizes the individual artist's presence in favor of a cohesive studio aesthetic. Dialogue serves as a crucial element, driving narrative progression and characterization, as well as delivering comedic moments.

In contrast, experimental animation subverts these norms, embracing abstraction through the use of non-representational shapes, forms, and rhythms. Rather than adhering to linear storytelling, experimental animation often embraces non-continuity, breaking free from logical progression to explore the inherent qualities of the medium itself, such as the manipulation of form, color, and movement. These works favor an interpretive form, leaving the meaning and significance open to the viewer's interpretation, encouraging active engagement rather than passive consumption of a predefined narrative.

Furthermore, Wells (1998) notes that experimental animation frequently emphasises the evolution of materiality, showcasing the unique properties of the medium, such as the texture of the artwork, the fluidity of motion, or the incorporation of unconventional materials. These works often embrace a multiplicity of styles within a single piece, combining various techniques, media, and aesthetic approaches to create a dynamic and visually diverse experience. Experimental animation also tends to foreground the presence of the artist, showcasing their unique creative vision and artistic process, making the artist's hand and creative decisions more visible within the work itself. Rather than relying heavily on dialogue, experimental animation tends to prioritise the dynamics of musicality, using the inherent rhythms, tempos, and visual compositions of the medium to create a more abstract, non-verbal form of expression that prioritises the interplay between sound and image.

#### Maureen Furniss' emphasis on context, funding, and subversive qualities

In her book "Art in Motion: Animation Aesthetics" (Furniss, 1998)  of which for this essay I had access to read only the revised version - and therefore cannot comment on any content that may have differed in the original - Furniss shares a similar definition to Paul Wells (1998) but with a few distinct differences.

Furniss (1998) like wells contrasts what she calls Traditional/industrial/hegemonic forms similar to Wells (1998) orthodox/commercial animation, with Experimental/Independent/Subversive forms.

![[Pasted image 20240420222021.png]]
```
Figure 2: Table directly taken from Maureen Furniss' Book "Art in motion, Revised Edition : Animation Asthetics (Furniss, 1998, p.30)
```

Like Wells (1998), Furniss (1998) agrees that experimental animation is non narrative, abstract and abstract and non-linear.

However Furniss (1998) also believes that  budget and scale of production team play an important role in defining an experimental animation. Explicitly stating that experimental animation tends to have small budgets and be made by individuals.  She also says the scope of the intended audience is important stating that traditional/industrial animation is intended for mainstream audiences whereas experimental forms lend themselves to tend to be limited to personal or small-scale exhibitions.

On-top of that Furniss (1998) states that the content and context of the animation is important in defining experimental animation by further providing three more tendencies of experimental animation - Stating the content tends to reflect alternate lifestyles to traditional societal norms, challenge dominant beliefs in the scope of the animation and be made by artists from marginalised social groups reflecting these groups concerns.

#### Paul Taberham's critique of previous scholars' definitions

In his chapter "It is Alive if You Are" from the book "Experimental Animation: From Analogue to Digital" (Taberham 2019), Paul Taberham provides a comprehensive analysis of experimental animation, building upon the definitions proposed by Paul Wells (1998) and Maureen Furniss (2009).

Taberham (2019) agrees with Wells (1998) and Furniss (2009) that experimental animation differs from orthodox or commercial animation in its emphasis on abstraction, non-continuity, interpretive form, and the presence of the artist's individual creative vision. However, he challenges some of Wells' (1998) specific claims, such as the notion that experimental animation necessarily embraces multiple animation techniques or is driven by dynamics of musicality.

Taberham (2019) proposes a set of tendencies that characterise experimental animation:

1. Context of production and distribution: Created by individuals or small collectives, self-financed or funded by small arts grants, and distributed independently online or through film societies and galleries without profit expectations.
2. Aesthetics: Evocative rather than explicit, emphasising surface details over content, consciously exposing the materials used, and lacking psychologically defined characters with clear motivations.
3. Role of the artist: The personal style and preoccupations of the artist are readily discernible, often expressing the inexpressible through non-rational intuition, with the creative process being a journey of discovery rather than executing a pre-planned vision.

Taberham (2019) highlights that experimental animations defy straightforward interpretation, inviting viewers to engage imaginatively and derive their own meaning. He emphasises the presence of the artist, which is more vividly felt due to the personal, individual nature of the creative process. Additionally, Taberham (2019) discusses the significance of surface details and exposing the materiality of the animation, drawing parallels with modernist art's embrace of the medium's inherent limitations and properties.

Overall, Taberham's (2019) definition builds upon and refines the previous definitions by Wells (1998) and Furniss (2009), offering a nuanced understanding of experimental animation as a creative approach that challenges conventional assumptions about filmmaking and invites viewers to engage with the work on a deeper, more imaginative level.

## Limitations of Categorical Definitions

While the definitions provided by Wells (1998), Furniss (2009), and Taberham (2019) offer valuable insights into the characteristics of experimental animation, they are shaped by the prevailing understanding and practices of what was considered experimental at the time they were formulated. As a result, these definitions may fail to fully capture the ever-evolving nature of the medium and the blurring boundaries between experimental and commercial animation.

One of the limitations of these categorical definitions is their inability to clearly delineate experimental animation from what Wells (1998) termed "developmental" animation. In the late 1990s, when Wells' definition was proposed, the distinction between experimental and commercial animation was perhaps more pronounced, with experimental works being largely non-narrative, abstract, and focused on exploring the inherent qualities of the medium. However, in the years since, the boundaries have become increasingly blurred, with some commercial animations incorporating experimental techniques and vice versa.

Additionally, these definitions tend to overlook the experimental works and techniques that were created for commercial gains or within the context of mainstream animation studios. While the definitions accurately capture the independent and avant-garde nature of experimental animation at the time, they may not fully account for the ways in which experimental techniques and aesthetics have been adopted and adapted by commercial animators and studios. For instance, the use of non-traditional animation techniques, such as stop-motion or mixed media, has become more prevalent in commercial productions, blurring the line between what was previously considered orthodox and experimental.

Furthermore, the definitions proposed by these scholars were shaped by the specific cultural and technological contexts in which they were formulated. For example, in 1998, when Wells' definition was published, the landscape of animation was notably different from what it is today, with digital technologies and the internet playing a smaller role in the creation and distribution of animated works. As such, these definitions may not fully capture the impact of technological advancements and new distribution channels on the nature of experimental animation.

While the insights provided by Wells (1998), Furniss (2009), and Taberham (2019) are invaluable in understanding the historical and theoretical foundations of experimental animation, it is essential to recognise the limitations of categorical definitions in capturing the fluid and ever-evolving nature of this artistic medium.



# Towards a Scope-Based Understanding of Experimental Animation

Hopefully you can now see that there is a need for a new way to define and think about experimental animation and this section will outline how i believe scope is what we should be using to narrow our definition of experimental animation not a set of arbitrary rules to decide what we should and shouldn't class as experimental animation.


## Embracing Literal Definitions

To develop a more inclusive and adaptable understanding of experimental animation, it is essential to consider the literal definitions of the terms "experimental" and "animation." By embracing these broad definitions, we can create a framework that allows for greater flexibility and innovation within the medium.

The term "experimental" can be understood as the invention of new artistic works or techniques, pushing the boundaries of what has been done before, based on new and untested ideas. In the context of animation, this means exploring novel approaches to the creation of moving frames and in the context of film the creation of moving images, whether through unconventional storytelling methods, unique visual styles, or innovative uses of technology.

Similarly, the term "animation" can be defined as the creation of moving frames from a sequence of still frames. This broad definition encompasses a wide range of techniques, from traditional hand-drawn cel animation to stop-motion, computer-generated imagery, and beyond. By not limiting the definition of animation to any specific technique or style, we open up the possibilities for experimentation and cross-pollination between different approaches.

By embracing these literal definitions, we can create a more inclusive understanding of experimental animation, one that values innovation, creativity, and the exploration of new frontiers within the medium. This approach allows for a diverse range of works to be considered experimental, based on their unique contributions to the art form, rather than adherence to a narrow set of criteria.

This avoids getting bogged down in overly rigid taxonomies or theoretical debates, and instead focuses on understanding the relative and contextual nature of "experimental" animation.

## Scope and Context in Defining Experimentalism

Defining experimental animation requires a careful consideration of the scope and context in which a work is created and viewed. The term "experimental" is inherently subjective, and its meaning can vary significantly based on the observer's frame of reference.

The perception of experimentalism is influenced by factors such as historical period, cultural background, and artistic discipline. A technique that was once innovative may become standard practice over time, while a narrative structure or visual style that deviates from mainstream norms may be seen as experimental within a specific context.

Furthermore, the context of presentation, such as the exhibition space, target audience, and cultural expectations, can impact how experimental a work is perceived to be. The same animation might be considered more experimental in a gallery setting than when viewed alongside similar and conventional content on a streaming platform.

Time also plays a crucial role in defining experimentalism. As animation techniques, technologies, and artistic trends evolve, so does the understanding of what constitutes experimental work. What was once cutting-edge may become commonplace as new innovations emerge.

Recognising the subjective and contextual nature of experimentalism allows for a more nuanced understanding of how animation can push the boundaries of the medium across various scopes and contexts. By embracing this perspective, we can appreciate the diverse ways in which animation can be experimental, without being constrained by rigid definitions or categories.

## Experimental within Niches, Developmental within Broader Scopes

The same animation techniques and approaches that are considered experimental within specific niche scopes can be seen as developmental when viewed from a broader scope. A holistic view reveals that animation is not an isolated art form, but rather a scope that exists within a wider global scope that houses an ecosystem of ideas, disciplines, and creative practices. Animation is influenced by and draws inspiration from diverse fields such as mathematics, film, computer science, and fine arts, to name a few.

Recognising this interconnectedness allows for a more dynamic understanding of how experimental ideas and techniques can be borrowed, adapted, and developed from areas both within and beyond the scope of animation. This cross-pollination of ideas fuels innovation and experimentation, as creators draw upon various sources of inspiration to push the boundaries of their medium.

Furthermore, defining a specific scope, such as an artistic movement, cultural context, or technological constraint, can provide a constructive framework for targeted experimentation. These constraints can act as catalysts for creativity, challenging artists to develop novel solutions within a set of parameters. By embracing a scope-based approach while keeping the overall definition of animation broad, creators can benefit from the free flow of ideas across different contexts while still focusing their experimentation within a defined scope.

This balanced perspective encourages targeted innovation within specific niches while fostering an open exchange of ideas across the wider landscape of creative practices. By recognising the value of experimentation within particular scopes and appreciating the developmental nature of animation within broader contexts, we can cultivate a more inclusive and dynamic understanding of experimental animation.





# Exploring a slither of the vast landscape of Experimental and Developmental  Eastern European Animation

Eastern European animation has a rich and diverse history that is unfortunatley often underappreciated in the western world. This section aims to shed light on the experimental and developmental aspects of Eastern European animation by exploring various scopes and case studies. By delving into the historical, cultural, and technological factors that have shaped the region's animation landscape, we can gain a deeper understanding of how these works have contributed to the broader evolution of the art form and appreciate the unique perspectives and creative visions that have emerged from this vibrant scene.

## Lev Atomanov

Lev Atamanov, a pioneering figure in Eastern European animation, made significant contributions to the experimental and developmental aspects of the art form. One of his early works, "Шунн у Катунь / Shunn u Katun" (1938), which translates to "The Dog and the Cat," holds the distinction of being the first Armenian animated short, marking a groundbreaking achievement in the history of Armenian animation.

Atamanov's influence extended beyond Armenia, as he went on to direct the highly acclaimed Soviet film "Снежная Королева / Snezhnaya Koroleva" (1957), known in English as "The Snow Queen," under the renowned studio Soyuzmultfilm. Created during the post-Stalin era, "The Snow Queen" became one of the most popular and successful animated Soviet films of its time. Its impact reached far beyond the Soviet Union, as it became the first Soviet animated film to be purchased by a major American company for distribution in the United States. The film's success and innovative techniques even inspired legendary Japanese animator Hayao Miyazaki, who cited it as a major influence in his decision to pursue a career in animation. "Miyazaki saw this film when he was unhappy about his job and wondering if he should continue working as an animator. Miyazaki was so moved by it, he 'decided to continue working on animation with renewed determination.' " https://cartoonresearch.com/index.php/the-soundtrack-albums-the-snow-queen-frozen/

Atamanov's experimental approach in "The Snow Queen" challenged the prevalent use of rotoscoping (practice of tracing over motion picture footage, frame by frame, to produce realistic action) in commercial animation during that period. He believed that the industry had become overly reliant on this technique, and as a result, he chose to limit its use in the film. With the exception of the Snow Queen herself, most characters were animated without the aid of rotoscoping. This artistic choice allowed Atamanov to imbue the Snow Queen with an "otherworldly feel," setting her apart from the other characters and adding to the film's unique visual style.

 Even with the reduction of rotoscoping a style which at the time dominated Disney productions many critics have called similar to disney it may be easy to say that this animation was therefore orthodox and not experimental however in the scope of soviet animation at the time this style of animation was still very developmental and from the frame of reference of a westerner this film was particularly experimental and rare so much so that The New York Times reviewer Bosley Crowther for the 1960 release of the film in United States was at first surprised that the film is from the Soviet Union and later is astounded by the similarity of Soyuzmultfilm's animation techniques with those of Disney studio.

## Theodore Ushev

In contrast to the previously discussed Eastern European animator Lev Atomanov, whose works predate the 2000s, it is essential to highlight the contributions of contemporary artist Theodore Ushev. Ushev's short films showcase his innovative approach to animation techniques and his ability to tackle profound themes through his work.

One of Ushev's most notable films, "The Physics of Sorrow," employs an experimental technique called encaustic painting. This ancient technique, which dates back to the time of the ancient Greeks, involves adding pigments to melted beeswax. While encaustic painting has a long history, Ushev's film marks the first time it has been used in animation, making it a groundbreaking development within the scope of the medium. The unique properties of the wax, which dries quickly but can be reheated and manipulated, allowed Ushev to create a distinctive visual style by capturing frames, reheating the wax, and moving the paint to animate the scenes.

"The Physics of Sorrow" explores powerful themes such as reincarnation, the cycle of life and death, war, childhood, Greek mythology, and the transient nature of existence. These themes are juxtaposed with the concept of memory and its ability to capture time, albeit temporarily. Ushev's personal connection to the story is evident in the film's closing message, where he speaks directly to the audience about the end of the world being a purely personal matter, dedicating the film to the memory of his father. The deeply personal brush strokes visible in the encaustic style amplify the emotional impact of the film's themes.

Another notable work by Ushev is his shorter, more abstract piece titled "Third Page of the Sun." This film stands out for its experimental use of physical paper torn from an animation film festival catalogue. By repurposing this material, Ushev addresses the increasingly ephemeral nature of media consumption and information in the digital age, making the film a developmental work within the broader context of this topic.

The animation of burning paper serves as a metaphor for "the end of paper" and highlights the artist's concerns about the destruction of our environment and the impact of global warming. Simultaneously, the use of recycled paper from a catalogue introduces the contrasting theme of recycling, adding another layer of depth to the film's message.

Theodore Ushev's work demonstrates the ongoing experimentation and development within Eastern European animation. By pushing the boundaries of traditional techniques and tackling thought-provoking themes, Ushev continues to contribute to the rich tapestry of the region's animation history while offering a contemporary perspective on the art form.

## Yuri Norstein

Yuri Norstein, a pioneering figure in Eastern European animation, is renowned for his distinctive style and innovative techniques that have left an indelible mark on the world of animation. Norstein's early works, such as "25 - е - первый день / 25 - e - pervyy den" (1968), "Времена года / Vremena goda" (1969), "Сеча при Керженце / Secha pri Kerzhentse" (1971), and "Лиза и заяц / Liza i zayats" (1973), utilised a developmental cutout style, laying the foundation for his later, more experimental works that would come to define his career. 

Norstein's second self-directed project, "Цапля и журавль / Tsaplya i zhuravl' " (1974), which translates to "The Heron and the Crane," marked a significant breakthrough in his artistic journey. Created alongside his wife, Francheska Yarbusova, this film introduced their custom-built device that allowed them to place cut-outs on several layers of glass, each of which could be moved independently on all three axes. This innovative technique gave the film with a unique sense of depth and became a hallmark of Norstein's subsequent works, setting them apart as highly experimental and visually captivating.

"The Heron and the Crane" also continued Norstein's willingness to experiment with mixed media as seen in some of his early works, this film also incorporated actual footage which in this case was of fireworks, demonstrating a developmental approach to storytelling. The short film carries a poignant message about how ego can cause issues in relationships, and kept the theme of animals and a more monotone colours from his previous film "Lisa i zayats" 

Norstein's third and most successful project, "Ежик в тумане / Yezhik v tumane" (1975), which translates to "Hedgehog in the Fog," has been widely acclaimed as one of the greatest animations ever made. The film ranked No. 1 in a poll at the 2003 Laputa Animation Festival, where animators from around the world voted for the best animated films of all time (Hedgehog in the Fog, no date). Legendary animator Hayao Miyazaki has cited "Hedgehog in the Fog" as one of his favorite films and a key source of inspiration (Hedgehog in the Fog, no date). While the film's commercial success might exclude it from being considered experimental under the definitions proposed by Wells, Furniss, and Taberham, it is essential to recognize the groundbreaking techniques employed by Norstein.

"Hedgehog in the Fog" expanded upon Norstein's now-developmental layered cut-out style and introduced an experimental technique for creating the dynamic fog effect. By placing a thin piece of paper on top of the scene and slowly lifting it toward the camera frame-by-frame, Norstein achieved a blurry and white effect that simulated fog (Sarkisov, 2004). This technique was revolutionary, as it was "the first special effect in Russian animation!" (Hedgehog in the Fog, no date).

Norstein's last film to date, "Сказка сказок / Skazka skazok" (1979), which translates to "Tale of Tales," is a more abstract 28-minute film that explores post-WWII Soviet society through the eyes of a sad little wolf. The film's non-linear presentation of scenes creates a memory-like portrayal of the world, with styles varying slightly from scene to scene. Although the techniques used in "Tale of Tales" are developmental, building upon Norstein's signature layered cut-out style, the film's abstract nature and thought-provoking themes set it apart as an experimental work. Norstein himself wrote in Iskusstvo Kino magazine that the film is "about simple concepts that give you the strength to live" (Lagunov, 2005).

Yuri Norstein's contributions to Eastern European animation have been immeasurable, and his influence continues to inspire animators worldwide. His innovative techniques, such as the layered cut-out style and the dynamic fog effect, have pushed the boundaries of the medium, while his films' profound themes and emotional depth have captivated audiences for generations. The film he is currently working on "Шине́ль / Shinyél’" has been his main project since 1981, around 25minutes of the film has been produced however as of 2024, the film remains unfinished, and its production time of over 40 years is the longest for any animated motion picture in history.
